# Testing-performance-of-classifiers-on-scRNA-seq-dataset
The code was written from scratch in order to compare the performance of a number of models on a single cell RNA-sequencing dataset in a systematic way. I have designed the code to load and preprocess the data and the architecture in which the models are tested, the results are collected, displayed and visualized.
